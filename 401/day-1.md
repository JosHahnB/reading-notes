## SQL 

Relational databases are like organized collections of data stored in tables, where each table represents a specific type of information, and the tables are related to each other based on common attributes. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to interact with these databases. It allows you to perform operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data from the tables. SQL uses simple commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manipulate the data. It provides a standardized way to work with relational databases, making it easier to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

Below are the images for the SQL exercises.
