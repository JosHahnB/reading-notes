# Day 10 notes

### Troubleshooting 

A syntax error is akin to a typo with your code. A logic error is a flaw in your code where your expectations and reality collide and the computer is not doing what you had intended. I have run into many errors. Syntax is really common but I really have no idea what I'm doing when I'm trying to write pure logic for code. This topic is important as syntax errors and logic errors and how you handle them are going to be a way of life.

### Debugger

I see the inspector tool as a roadmap for the website code. Also it is a way to use the console and troubleshoot javascript down to a source problem. Breakpoints are a bookmark to stop the debugger from travelling all the way through your code if you are looking for a specific problem area. The callstack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
