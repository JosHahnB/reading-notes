# Day 9 notes

### Forms

As I understand forms, they are very important because they transmit data from users to servers for storage to call upon at a later time. Some things to keep in mind when desigining forms is accesssability, and it seems as though you dont want to use a `reset` button. 
`form` defines the form and applicable attributes
`label` is the most important elemnt for accessablility, as it allows screen readers identify it to the user with the instructions.
`input` is where the user will put information
`type` allows the browser to know what function the element is applying

### JS Events

Events are essentially a reaction to something you do on a webpage. If you click on a button or fill out a form a developer can set up an event that will have a certain effect. An event object can be used to add additional functionality to an event. Event capture is the reverse of event bubbling. Instead of starting on the inside elemnt, it will start on the outside element.
