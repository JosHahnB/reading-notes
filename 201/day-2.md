# Day 2 notes

## HTML

It is important to use semantic elements because they convey meaning. It makes a huge difference when somone is using a screen reader. There are 6 different HTML heading levels. They generally just refer to the font-size and some semantics. There are certain HTML tags that are used for dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations. They are superscripts and subscripts. Abbreviation tags (abbrv) are used to for titles in names (such as reverend) as well as acronyms.

## CSS

There are 3 ways to use CSS and have it work in conjunction with HTML: external stylesheet, internal stylesheet, and inline styles. Inline styles will work, however they will make your HTML code more difficult to read and when you have to change something on the webpage, it will likely add more work. 
- h2 is a selector
- a declaration is 'color' or 'padding'
- and a property would be a color 'black' or a pixel number '5px'

## Javascript

A sequence of text enclosed in quotes is called a string. It is different than a number, but a number with quotes is called a string, not a number. 
-  = assigns value to a variable
- +adds numbers or combines strings
- === checks to see if two values are absolute equal
- *is multiplication of numbers

I think a real world problem you could solve with a function is a simiple calculator. 
An 'if' statement checks a condition, and if it evaluates to 'true or false' then the code block will execute. An if/else statement will allow you to choose betwenn a true or false selection. There are many different comparison operators.
- === is strict equality
- < less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `**` exponet

&& is an AND operator, || is an OR operator. AND allows you to link two more more expressions so that all must come up TRUE for the expression to return TRUE.
OR operators link expressions so that at least one has to evaluate to true for the expression to return true.
