### Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is a process where you create a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A well created domain model can help you troubleshoot and comprehend the problem.

### Tables
Tables should not be used for page layouts because they are incredibly hard for screen readers to translate. It seems to make accessability non-existent. This was a thing of the past before CSS was not as well rounded as it is now, but no longer is the standard to make web pages with tables.
`th` is semantic for table header
`tb` is table body
`tf` is table footer

### Constructors

Constructors are beautiful formulas where you can build one constructor, and plug in an unlimited amount of objects within it. Now if you need to add or subtract a property, you can just adjust your constructor, and it will change all of your objects plugged in.
