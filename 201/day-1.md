### Parsed

HTML is parsed first so there is a structure to the web page. 
After that, CSS  file links and `script` tags are located. As the HTML is building the browser retireves the CSS and JS files to add.
CSS is added, and then JS.

### Images

to locate an image you would want to start on google and search for the image type you a looking for. To avoid copyright you can use googles license filter. click 'tools', then 'usage rights' and select 'creative comons liscenses'. This will only show pictuers that are free for use.

### Javascript

#### Strings vs Numbers

The difference between strings and numbers in JS are going to be the single quotes. '1' is not necessarily equal to 1. if you try to add '1' + 1 you will get 11 because '1' in quotes is a string and will be tacked on the end of what you are adding it to.

#### Variables

Variables are boxes that hold a value. It is much easier to move a bunch of books that are organized in a box than it is to move them individually. Variables are various boxes of items that can be used over and over by just one keyword, or they can be reassigned how many books are in the box, or what type of books, or even change the items from books to chocolate if you want.
Variables are eternally malleable and have unlimited uses which is why they play such a vital role for JavaScript. 


### HTML

HTML is essentially a structural markup language that gives a web browser the blueprint for how it will look.
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, which is usually a letter/number in a bracket < > and a closing tag </ >. The information between the two tags is translated to the browswer screen.
An attribute is additional information for the element that the user will not see on the browser. There is a special format that determine what an attribute will be identified as.
Articles are generally a few paragraphs that are stand-alone information. They are not required to be related to other information. Sections can have multiple componets consisting of information, maps and even articles. 
There are several diffeent elements that are typical in every website. Headers, navigation, main content, sidebars and footers are common.
Metadata discriptions have keywords that search engines look at to decide if it is a web page that someone is looking for. Meta tags are used in the head element. They can be used for many different things, but specifying the author of the website and what the website content is about are primary aspects.

### Web design

The first step in designing a website is knowing what it's primary function will be for. Once you list out your goals for the website and prioritize them then you can start building. 

### Semantics

The benefits of using semantic tags in HTML is that it assigns roles to the element. For example, using an H1 tag would tell the browser that the wrapped content is in fact a primary heading. If you just used a span element instead of a h1, the browser would not know that it is the primary, and you would need to style it to look like a heading. h1 by itself would automatically show up in large font, but you can style it differently if you prefer.

### Javascript

Javascript is a programming language that can display scrolling text, flashing lights, have pop-ups, 3D graphics, and prettymuch any interactive function you would like to have on a webpage. Thee are several ways to add Javascript to an HTML document. One of my favorites is using functions. You can assign a protocol to a specific word, and insert that word in the HTML element where you would like it to appear or work.
