# Day 4 notes

## Links

To create a link, you would wrap content in an `a` element. The `href` attribute contains the location of the content, or where you will be going to. You can add link text to aid in accessibility. When a screen reader 'hovers' over a link, it will read the link text. Having clear link text is important.

### Normal Flow

Normal flow is the standard method a web page is structured. Block level elements are laid out in a standard english left to right orientation. Every element is on a seperate line and will be read in a top to bottom format. Inline elements are on the same line as the text. If there is too much content, then the text will go down to the next level and continue. Static positioning is the standard for all elements. With absolute positioning you are able to isolate a block so you can have UI features that do not interfere with other elemnts. These are generally used for pop-ups and other features. The differenece between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is fixed position can scroll with the screen, such as a navigation bar that stays with you.

### Functions

The difference between a function declaration and a function invocation is one is the declaration is the block of programmed code, and a invocation is a calling card to for when to use that block of code.

### Pair programming

I believe pair programming is going to be really cool. There is allot to learn from another student, as you likely have differnt subject matter you each understand better. You can build off eachothers strengths and cover eachothers weak spots. It will be more fun to work with someone else on a project as opposed to doing it alone.
