# Day 3 notes

## HTML

There are ordered lists and unordered lists. you can use an ordered list when the list in question has a particular sequence for how you want to display it. It is possible to change the numbering type by adding the `type` attribute to the `li` element. You should use an unordered list when the order of listed items is not relevant. You can change the style of bullet points for the unordered list in CSS with the list-style-type property.

## CSS
