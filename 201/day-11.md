# Day 11 notes

### Vidoe and Audio

The src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface.

### Grid

flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension and Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout at the same time. `Grid Container` is the direct parent of all the grid items.`Grid Item` is the children of the container. `Grid Line` is the dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal.

### Responsive Images

Responsive images are useful because there are many different kinds of screen sizes. Images do not necessarily fit in every screen size. `srcset` defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.
