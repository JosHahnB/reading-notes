# Day 8 notes

### Flexbox

Flexbox is functionality that is used for moving many items with different sizing and placing it in a layout that makes sense. Main axis is set by `flex direction`property and you can set the main axis depending on row or column. cross axis is the opposite of what the main axis is set to. The flex items will move as one unit along the main axis. There are certain properties in flexbox that can impact accessability such as `row-reverse` and `coulmn-reverse`

long term, knowing properties of flexbox will aid me  because it will be one more aspect of understanding that I have for job applications. This is also a primary aspect of creating web-pages, which I've considered doing for some friends and compaines for monies to develop a portfolio.
