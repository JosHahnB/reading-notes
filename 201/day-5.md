# Day 5 notes

### HTML Images

Alternative test describes the image. If the image does not display then the alt text will show, descibing what you would have or eventually will see. If the user is utilizing a screen reader, then the alt text will describe the image, aiding in accessability. A figure element adds semantics to an image. A GIF has been around since 1987, which is way longer than I thought. GIF's are 8-bit animations that are simple in nature. They should not be used in place of PNG images and APNG animations. SVG is great for diagrams, icons and images that can be scaled to any size. I would use PNG for a screenhsot, as it would retain the most clear image.

### CSS

foreground is the color of the backround on the entire webpage. Background-color can be used to change the backround in a certain spot on the web-page. I would consider the contrast. font-size is the size of the characters on the screen. font-weight is essentially a boldness selector. and font-style is the actual character style and how they appear. You can add padding or margin to make space around certian text or items with css.
