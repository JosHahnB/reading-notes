# Day 6 notes

### Objects

An object is a compilation of a family of data. There can be multiple variables and functions involved.Object literals are best to use when you transfer related data. They are also simpler than arrays when you want to identify items by name. if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value.

In the provided code `this` refers to `dog`. `this` is advantageous to use because you dont have to remember to type each different object name you create. You are able to just slap in `this` before each property and the code knows what you're referring to.

What is the DOM?
Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

### Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is an interface for web documents. It is a representation of the web page so programs can change the structure, style and content. DOM is representative of noeds and objects so it can be touched by different programming languages.

As I understand it, the DOM is a translator telling JavaScript what the webpage is and manipulates it to what it's supposed to look like.

## Things I want to learn more about

I'm interested in learning more about applying objects to code. 
Understanding the DOM seems like an integral piece of understanding how programming languages interact with a browser.
