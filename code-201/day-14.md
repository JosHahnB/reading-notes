# Day 14 notes

### CSS Transform

`Transfrom`  property has two-dimensional and three-dimensional settings. Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 

### Transitions and Animations

For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `hover`, `focus`, `active`, and `target` pseudo-classes.  Animations can only apply a transition within a single property, not from one property to another.

I am interested in trying out the animation properties. They make a website more fun and interactive for a user. I plan to be making a few websites and will most certainly be implementing these methods into them for practice, and I plan for a website to be used as a project on my resume.
