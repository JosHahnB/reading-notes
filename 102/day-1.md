# 1st day notes/summary

Today was the first day of class and reproducing the results has been a bit overwhelming. There are many different commands 
in the Markdown coding language but some of it is quite simple, especially if you have a [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

For example:

1. To make a word look **bold** all you need to do is add two stars(*) before and after the content you wish to make bold. 
2. If you only wanted to make a word *italicized* you would only need one star(*).

## Things I want to learn more about

1. I would like to practice Markdown more.
2. I would like to learn more about navigating GitHub
