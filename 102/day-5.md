## Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a rule based language. You can declare a specific element or multiple elements for the rules for the rules to apply. The next step is to decide the rule changes you want and stick them between the curly braces `{}`. There are many different rules such as color, size, location you can change with CSS. The rules inside the curly braces are called **declarations**.
