# Day 7 notes

Today was an interesting day of learning functions. They were slightly confusing at first, but they act in a similar way to CSS in that they are all located in a different file so they can be organized. The way to invoke these functions is to use functionName(); in your file you want them used. They are invoked in order of where in the file they are placed. Functions greatly decrease the amount of repettitive code you need to write and help the organization of files.
