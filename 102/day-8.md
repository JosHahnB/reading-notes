# Day 8 notes

Javascript loops are an awesome tool. You can count through a series of numbers, count and exempt a number (or as many as you want), you can count backwards, and I'm sure there are an unlimited amount of other applications to use with it. I blelieve the primary purpose is to repeat a process untill a desired result is acheieved. 

## Things I want to learn more about
