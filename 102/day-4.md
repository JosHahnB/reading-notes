## Wireframing

Wireframing is a term in the tech industry used to describe the designing your website/app layout. There are primarily two different ways that people use. 

1. The ol' pen and paper
2. Using a design app

Some people will start on paper to get a basic layout and then switch to the app depending on how detailed they would like their program to be. Pen/paper is typically faster to get multiple sketches, which is why it's a popular place to start. Some of the wireframing apps have in-depth tools such as prototypes, which will populate a basic app and you can 'test' the button layout and functionality.

 How to start:

- Find out who you think will be using the app. Back up your case with reaearch from competitors and the industry
- Hand sketch a layout for website or use an app for design
- How many screens will you have?
- **information architecure and user flow**
  - Less customer support inquiries
  - Higher customer satisfaction
  -simple is usually better
